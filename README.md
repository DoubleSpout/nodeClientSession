# client-session(fast and simple nodejs client cookie session)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DoubleSpout/nodeClientSession.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DoubleSpout/nodeClientSession)

nodejs client cookie session middleware, support cross process and multi server without any other database(such as redis or mongodb) to store session data, cookie is encryption and md5 verify signatures. 

the module are also be used in express framework.

## Installing the module

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

ifile module is supported windows, linux, mac.

Make sure, node-gyp has installed.

     npm install client-session

From source:

     git clone https://github.com/DoubleSpout/nodeClientSession.git
     cd nodeClientSession
     node-gyp rebuild

To include the module in your project:

     var cs = require('client-session');

##simple example

		var http = require('http');
		var cs = require('client-session'); 
		var clientSession = cs('mysecretkey');

		http.createServer(function (request, response) {
		   if(request.url == '/favicon.ico') return response.end(''); //stop '/favicon.ico' request

		   clientSession.csget(request, response);//get csession
		   var count = request.csession['count'];//use session

		   if(!count) count = 1;
		   else	count++
 
           request.csession['count'] = count; //update session
		   clientSession.csset(request, response);//flush session to cookie

		   response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
		   response.end(count.toString()); //response count add every time

		}).listen(8124);
		console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');

when you run the example,you will see count +1 every time in your browser

##express 4.x example

		var express = require('express');
		var path = require('path')
		var cs = require('client-session');
		var clientSession = cs('mysecretkey');
		var app = express();
		app.use(clientSession.connect());
		app.get('/', function(req, res){
		  var count = req.csession['count'];
		  if(!count) count = 1;
		  else count++;
		  req.csession['count'] = count;
		  //sync to cookie session equal to res.csflush(),make sure to call it before response
		  req.csflush(); 
		  res.send(count.toString());
		});
		app.listen(8124);
		console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');

##clinet-session work flow:
1.Generation middleware and set the key which is strong enough

2.When client request is comming,send the req,res and cookie string to c++ addon

3.get the client session data from cookie string, and store it in req object

4.Before server respones the client, generate the signature and store it in res objec, and then add cookie into response header.

##notice
1.The client-session must be smaller than 1k,so it better to store userid or username.

2.Although the clinet-session cookie is encryption, better not store passowrd in it,just store user's identity.

3.To use client-session, without the use of ip hash or cookie hash, client-session works fine.

4.To use clinet-session, you never need database such as redis to store session data,they are all stored in the browser's cookie.
